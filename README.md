Image Entity Value Extraction - Hackathon Solution
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning solution designed to extract entity values such as dimensions, weight, wattage, etc., from product images. This project is useful in fields like e-commerce, healthcare, and content moderation, where extracting accurate product information is essential. The extracted information includes measurements and values that are predicted in a format of value unit (e.g., 12.5 centimetre, 500 gram).

The solution generates a CSV file of predictions that matches the required format, ready for submission.
